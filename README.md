This is a repo that I used to keep private and tend to include in all my projects. It includes fucntionality that I found useful and common accross projects.

I aim to keep it lightweight and highly protable. 

If you find it useful and/or feel like you have some other useful additions and/or modifications please send a Pull Request.
