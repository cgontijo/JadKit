# JadKit

This is a repo that I used to keep private and tend to include in all my projects. It includes fucntionality that I found useful and common accross projects.

I aim to keep it lightweight and highly protable. 

If you find it useful and/or feel like you have some other useful additions and/or modifications please send a Pull Request.

I [gave a presentation](https://realm.io/news/slug-jad-osseiran-protocol-extension-list-controller/) on the [Protocols](https://github.com/jad6/JadKit/tree/master/JadKit/Protocols) section of this framework for more context on how to use it.
